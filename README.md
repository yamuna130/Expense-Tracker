# Expense Tracker

A simple, browser-based Expense Tracker built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**.  
It allows users to add, view, and delete transactions, while automatically calculating **Total Income**, **Total Expenses**, and **Current Balance** in real time.  
Data is stored in the browser's **localStorage**, making the application offline-capable and easy to deploy without a backend.
